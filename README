Compile Instruction
	type: make

Operating instructions:
	xsd [objectfile, symfile], [outputfile]
	Note: all arguments are optional. If none is provide, test.obj and test.sym will be used. 
	      if Objectfile is provided, symfile is required
		  The default output name is SourceCode.sic
	
	example runs
	./dasm 
	./dasm test2.obj test2.sym
	./dasm test2.obj test2.sym output.sic
		  

Design Decisions:
	We decided to use object oriented approach
.'

Extra Feature:
	Everything is as per the instruction, no additional features
	
Known Deficiencies of bugs:
	None

Lessons Learned
	We learned much about different feature of C++
